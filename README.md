# Facial-Emotion-Recognition
Ever felt no one understands your emotions? Here's a Computer Vision project that does.</br>
This project repurposes SOTA ResNet-152 Architecture trained on ImageNet and fine tuned on human emotion dataset to detect human emotions.

## Requirements/Libraries:
* Python 3.6.9
* Tensorflow 2.0
* Keras 2.2.4
* Numpy 1.15.4
* Matplotlib 3.0.2
* OpenCV 4.2.0

## Dataset:
The dataset is taken from kaggle - [FER(Facial Emotion Recognition) Challenge](https://www.kaggle.com/ashishpatel26/facial-expression-recognitionferchallenge)

## Challenge:
###### The dataset is large and is taking a very long time to train the neural network
